# web-scraping-challenge

This project was definitely the most difficult one so far. 

In Part 1, I started by scraping the code for the most recent news article title and paragraph and assigning them to variables to be used in my scrapy.py.
Then I made sure for the featured image that it was scraping the code for the featured image by going through the 'featured image' button located on the browser.
Then I grabbed the html version of the table for the Mars facts. For this table, I had to delete the first row as it copied the column headers in two rows. 
For the last part of part 1, I scraped the images and titles of the images for the hemispheres and zipped them all in the same dictionary.

For Part 2, I downloaded my jupyter notebook as a python file then cleaned out some of the unnecessary code (displaying variables).  
I defined the body as scrape and linked it to my app.py.  
I created my index.html and included a screenshot of browser window without the scrape to show the code placements to go with the screenshot that contains the scraped image.
I included a styles.css file but did not end up using it and coded all my formatting with bootstrap inside the index.html document.

Overall, this assignment was definitely the hardest one for me.  I used a tutoring session, several office hour sessions, and working with my study group and I still took longer to complete it than normal.
